# cjohansen-no

This is a demonstration app that shows how to put together a static website with
Clojure and these libraries:

* [Stasis](http://github.com/magnars/stasis)
* [Optimus](http://github.com/magnars/optimus)
* [enlive](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive)
* [hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup)
* [cegdown](https://github.com/Raynes/cegdown)
* [clygments](https://github.com/bfontaine/clygments)
* [Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje)

The hows and whys are explained in thorough detail in
[this post](http://cjohansen.no/building-static-sites-with-stasis).

This repo will eventually evolve into my new website.

## Usage

Export site to disk

```sh
lein build-site
```

Run the live server

```
