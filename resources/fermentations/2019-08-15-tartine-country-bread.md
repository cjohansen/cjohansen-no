:title Autolyse
:ingredients

Autolysed in 22C ambient temperature overnight.

:title Levain
:ingredients
[{:type :sourdough-starter :amount 50 :indirect-use? true}
 {:type :white-wheat :amount 50 :indirect-use? true}
 {:type :fine-whole-wheat :amount 50 :indirect-use? true}
 {:type :water :amount 100 :indirect-use? true}]

Starter is active and on a twice-a-day feeding schedule. I built the levain at
the same time as the autolyse.

The levain was about 12 hours when I made the dough. Combined roughly into the
autolyse.

:title Bulk fermentation
:time 360
:body

I gave the dough four turns at 30 minute intervals. Bulk fermentation went for
almost six hours total, including one in a car trunk...

:title Shaping
:time 300
:body

I pre-shaped two loaves, let them rest for 20 minutes, then did the final
shaping. I stuck one basket into the fridge, and left the other on the counter.
The idea was to see if retarding made any noticable difference to the crust.
I've made sourdough breads in the past with a very tough/gummy crust, and
wondered if retarding added to this effect. It seems it doesn't, so probably my
previous breads have just been badly fermented.

:title Results
:body

I started reading [Open Crumb
Mastery](http://www.breadwerx.com/open-crumb-mastery/) the day after pulling
this bread from the oven. While I was initially quite happy with the loaf, I
quickly understood from the book that it is quite far from the potential. Gotta
keep baking.

:title Loaf #2
:image-alt Second bread

The second loaf spent about 12 hours in the fridge and came out very similar to
the first one, I'm not sure I could detect any difference, to be honest.
