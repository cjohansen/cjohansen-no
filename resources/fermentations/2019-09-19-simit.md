After the both promising, and somewhat disappointing results from yesterday, I
decided to attempt another batch of
[simit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simit), this time armed with a little more
than absolutely no research.

:title Autolyse
:ingredients
[{:type :white-wheat :amount 500}
 {:type :water :amount 170}]
:time 30
:body

For timing issues, I went with a straight dough with an autolyse.

I Adjusted the hydration down to 68%. I'm not really sure an autolyse has much
effect at such low hydration, but I figured it couldn't hurt. Let it go for 30
minutes.

:title Dough
:ingredients
[{:type :salt :amount 10}
 {:type :yeast :amount 2}]
:time 5
:body

I cut the dough a couple of times, then kneaded it on the counter-top for a few
minutes, until it gained medium strength.

Finalized the dough at 26C, a little cold. The kitchen is also on the lower end
at 21C.

:title Bulk fermentation
:time 300
:body

Dough fermented in a 21C kitchen for 5 hours. The dough went into the bowl with
good strength, so I only gave it two folds, after 30 and 60 minutes.

:title Shaping
:time 80
:body

My minimal research this time revealed that the simit is indeed a braided piece
of bread. I thoroughly suck at picky shaping work such as braiding, so this was
a bit of a frustrating exercise for me, and the results were so-so. As the last
time, I move half the batch to the fridge, and left the other half on the
counter for an hour of proofing.

:title Baking
:time 40
:body

As per my research, I dunked the simits in a solution of water and malt syrup,
then seeds, and then transferred to the oven. "Turkish bagels" are starting to
make sense to me now. Baked under foil for 15 minutes, and uncovered for another
15 minutes, all at 245C. The color came out paler than with the egg wash.
However, these were less chewy than my first attempt, the crust was crunchy but
not too thich. Relatively successful, but it's not quite there yet.
