After yesterday's wet attempt, I decided to try for a sunflower seed bread
again, using a biga instead of a poolish, and leaving out the whole wheat
entirely.

Poured hot water on seeds and flakes, wrapped foil over, left to soak overnight.

Combined into a firm dough in the morning, and left it to ripen for 10 hours.

I roasted the sunflower seeds, then combined everything roughly into a dough.
The original bread I'm sorta recreating does not have whole wheat, so I skipped
it this time. The reduced hydration landed me a dough much closer to the
handling quality I was looking for, if maybe just a tad bit too stiff.

The dough was slightly resistant of stretches, but I still gave it four of 'em,
a little more spaced out than usual - 20-30 minutes between each.

I shaped this dough into a somewhat tight boule with no bench rest.

:title Baking
:time 50
:body

Baked in a dutch oven at 245C for 50 minutes. Bread got a nice lift in the oven,
and came out spectacular. Omitting the whole wheat really is a pre-requisite for
this bread to shine. The lightness of the moist crumb with the toasted seeds and
the thin, crispy crust makes it quite delicious. I love whole wheat breads too,
but in this constellation, the whole wheat detracts from the lightness and
bright flavor.
