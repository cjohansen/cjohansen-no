My attempt at recreating Hamelman's sunflower bread using wetter dough without a
machine continues.

Poured hot water on seeds and flakes, wrapped foil over, left to soak overnight.

Combined into a poolish in the morning, and left it to ripen for 10 hours.

 {:type :whole-wheat :amount 250}
 {:type :water :amount 200 :temperature 60}

I roasted the sunflower seeds, then combined everything roughly into a dough. I
kinda regret using a poolish with this dough. Because there was so much water in
the soaker already, this gave me little to work with to incorporate the flour. I
ended up pushing the hydration quite high, yielding a tad bit too wet dough.

The dough temperature at the end of the mix was 28.1C.

:title Bulk fermentation
:time 210
:body

Performed fairly strong stretch and folds every 15 minutes the first hour, then
every 30 minutes until an hour before completed fermentation.

The dough developed nice strength and was gassy, but still quite sticky. I guess
the hydration level in combination with the amount of flax seeds is to blame for
this.

:title Shaping
:time 75
:body

Once again, a sticky dough made for difficult shaping. I pre-shaped, rested for
15 minutes, and then shaped into batards. Unfortunately, I screwed up one of the
batards, so it was rounded again, rested another 10 minutes, and then shaped and
left in the basket.

:title Baking
:time 50
:body

Coming out of the basket, you couldn't really tell that these put up a fight
during shaping. I baked them for 50 minutes at 245C as per usual, in my oval
dutch oven. The resulting breads came out quite nice.
