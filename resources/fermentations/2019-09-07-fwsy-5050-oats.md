An experiment: An oatmeal bread based on the plain and 50% whole wheat breads in
[Flour Water Salt Yeast](https://kensartisan.com/flour-water-salt-yeast/).

## Pre-ferment

Made poolish before going to bed, around 23:30. Kitchen was at 20C.

- 500g White wheat flour
- 500g Water
- 0.4g Yeast

## Dough

- 250g Coarse whole wheat flour
- 250g White wheat flour
- 100g Flaked oats
- 200g Milk, 38C
- 100g Water, 38C
- 50g Soft butter
- 22g Salt
- 3g Yeast

Combined water, milk and sugar and proofed the yeast in the mixture for a few
minutes. Then combined everything, added it to the poolish and combined
everything using the [pincer
method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s). I then kept kneeding and
working the dough until it had some strength. I'm a little worried the fat in
the milk and butter will inhibit the dough too much, so I figured I might as
well give it a strong start.

Finished the dough at the target temperature of 28C.

## Bulk fermentation

Doughs fermented in a 24C kitchen for 3.5 hours, stretches every 15 or so
minutes the first hour.

## Shaping

I formed loose rounds and let them rest for 20 minutes. I then shaped them into
batards and transferred them to a couple of bread pans for final proofing.

## Baking

Baked in the pans at 245C for about 40 minutes.
