Another batch of Ken Forkish' 50% whole wheat bread with a yeasted pre-ferment
from [Flour Water Salt Yeast](https://kensartisan.com/flour-water-salt-yeast/).
Added some sesames to half the dough.

## Pre-ferment

Made the pre-ferment in the morning. I doubled the yeast, as I didn't have time
to let it go for 12 hours.

- 500g White wheat flour
- 340g Water
- 0.8g Yeast

Combined and let rest in room temperature ~24C, quite humid.

## Dough

- 500g Fine whole wheat flour
- 460g Water, 38C
- 22g Salt
- 3g Yeast

Hydrated and proofed the yeast in the warm water for a few minutes, until I
combined it all to a paste, added it to the pre-ferment and combined everything
using the [pincer method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s).

Gave the dough some stretches to develop it a little, and finished the mix with
the dough at the target temperature of 28C.

## Bulk fermentation

After 15 minutes I split the dough into two tubs, and added 60 grams of toasted
sesame seeds to one. Did 4 folds at 15 minute intervals. Bulk fermentation
lasted for 3.5 hours in a 24C kitchen.

## Shaping

I formed loose rounds and let them rest for 20 minutes. Then shaped rough
batards, and transferred to appropriate baskets. One went into the refrigerator,
and the other sat on the counter in a 24C kitchen for close to 60 minutes.

## Baking

Baked in an oval dutch oven with lid for 30 minutes, then uncovered for 20
minutes. All at 245C. Immediately after pulling the first loaf, I baked the
second one from the fridge.

I sliced the first one, which only helped it ooze a little on the side, so
decided against doing the same with the next. It was probably a mistake, because
the second loaf had slightly poorer lift.
