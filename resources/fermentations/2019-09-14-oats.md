Another batch of my oatmeal bread under development. This time I remembered to
put in some sugar, as was the intention the first time around.

## Pre-ferment

Made the pre-ferment before going to bed as usual. Kitchen was at 21C.

- 500g White wheat flour
- 340g Water
- 0.4g Yeast

## Dough

- 250g Coarse whole wheat flour
- 250g White wheat flour
- 100g Flaked oats
- 360g Water, 38C
- 200g Milk, 38C
- 50g Soft butter
- 30g Sugar
- 22g Salt
- 3g Yeast

Combined oats, water, milk, sugar, and yeast and let it sit for a few minutes.
Then added the rest, worked it into a coherent mass, and combined it with the
pre-ferment using the [pincer
method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s).

Dough finished close to the target temperature of 28C, at 27C.

## Bulk fermentation

Dough fermented in a 22C kitchen for 4 hours, stretches every 15 or so minutes
the first hour.

## Shaping

I formed loose rounds and let them rest for 20 minutes. I then shaped into
batards, transferred to loaf pans, and set one on the counter to proof. The
other one went directly to the fridge.

## Baking

Baked in an oval dutch oven, lid on for 30 minutes, then uncovered for 20 minutes. All
at 245C. Immediately after pulling the first, I baked the one proofing in the
fridge. This timing works out well with this dough.

Unfortunately I completely forgot to snap photos this time, but the breads were
quite successful.
