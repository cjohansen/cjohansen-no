:title Tartine Country Bread with Butter and Poppy Seeds
:description

I recently spent time in Denmark, and Danish bakers make amazing white bread,
often with poppy seeds. I love that stuff - it's extremely light and fluffy, has
a papery thin crust, which tastes of nicely toasted poppy seeds. I really want
to have a bread like this in my reportoire, and I want to make it from my
sourdough. This is my first attempt.

Please note that I am truly an amateur and have no idea what I'm doing, I'm just
trying a few tricks I've picked up from books.

The idea is to add a little butter - 7.5% - to make the crumb more tender, and
tighter, like the breads I'm hoping to mimick. I'm also adding 5% milk powder,
to aid in evening out the crumb structure.

Autolyse sat in room temperature overnight, then (for practical reasons)
traveled by car for 90 minutes in the trunk at about 16C...

Starter is active and on a twice-a-day feeding schedule. I built the levain at
08:30 this morning.

[{:type :levain :amount 200}

The dough was mixed at 13:30, so the levain was 5 hours old, not quite peaking,
but I know it to peak out around the 8 hour mark, so I trust it'll be fine - it
did float for what it's worth. This is my first attempt at using the levain this
young. Combined roughly into the autolyse.

:title Butter and milk powder
:ingredients
[{:type :butter :amount 75}
 {:type :milk-powder :amount 50}]
:body

I gave the dough turns at 30 minute intervals, and after the first two (1 hour
of fermentation), I made a paste of the butter and milk powder, and incorporated
it into the dough. For the third turn, the dough was noticably softer.

:title Bulk fermentation
:time 480
:body

This dough just never gained any kind of strength. I'm not sure what went wrong,
but there are multiple suspects:

- Milk powder
- Butter

Could be too much of these? Maybe these additions require more mechanical
handling of the dough to develop it - I've used similar amounts in breads that
were mixed by machine with great luck.

- Too cold autolyse
- Too weak levain

I did let bulk fermentation go for an extended 8 hours, but still there was very
little hold. I did try to bake the result, but sadly it was inedible.
