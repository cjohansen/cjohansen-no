I recently spent time in Denmark, and Danish bakers make amazing white bread,
often with poppy seeds. I love that stuff - it's extremely light and fluffy, has
a papery thin crust, which tastes of nicely toasted poppy seeds. I really want
to have a bread like this in my reportoire, and I want to make it from my
sourdough. This is my first attempt.

Please note that I am truly an amateur and have no idea what I'm doing, I'm just
trying a few tricks I've picked up from books.

The idea is to add a little butter - 7.5% - to make the crumb more tender, and
tighter, like the breads I'm hoping to mimick. I'm also adding 5% milk powder,
to aid in evening out the crumb structure.

## Autolyse

- 700g relatively cold water
- 1000g white wheat flour

Autolyse sat in room temperature overnight, then (for practical reasons)
traveled by car for 90 minutes in the trunk at about 16C...

## Levain

Starter is active and on a twice-a-day feeding schedule. I built the levain at
08:30 this morning:

- 50g Starter
- 100g Water
- 50g Whole wheat flour
- 50g White wheat flour

## Dough

The dough was mixed at 13:30, so the levain was 5 hours old, not quite peaking,
but I know it to peak out around the 8 hour mark, so I trust it'll be fine - it
did float for what it's worth. This is my first attempt at using the levain this
young.

- 20g salt
- 200g levain

Combined roughly into the autolyse.

## Butter and milk powder

- 75g butter, soft
- 50g milk powder

I gave the dough turns at 30 minute intervals, and after the first two (1 hour
of fermentation), I made a paste of the butter and milk powder, and incorporated
it into the dough. For the third turn, the dough was noticably softer.

## Bulk fermentation

This dough just never gained any kind of strength. I'm not sure what went wrong,
but there are multiple suspects:

- Milk powder
- Butter

Could be too much of these? Maybe these additions require more mechanical
handling of the dough to develop it - I've used similar amounts in breads that
were mixed by machine with great luck.

- Too cold autolyse
- Too weak levain

I did let bulk fermentation go for an extended 8 hours, but still there was very
little hold. I did try to bake the result, but sadly it was inedible.
