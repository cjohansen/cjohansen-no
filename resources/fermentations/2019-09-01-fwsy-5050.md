A batch of Ken Forkish' 50% whole wheat bread with a yeasted pre-ferment from
[Flour Water Salt Yeast](https://kensartisan.com/flour-water-salt-yeast/). Split
in half for batch fermentation and added flax seeds and roasted sunflower seeds
to one, and roasted sesames to the other.

## Pre-ferment

Made the pre-ferment before going to bed, around 00:30. Kitchen was at 23C.

- 500g White wheat flour
- 340g Water
- 0.3g Yeast

## Dough

- 500g Fine whole wheat flour
- 460g Water, 38C
- 22g Salt
- 3g Yeast

Hydrated and proofed the yeast in the warm water for a few minutes, until I
combined it all to a paste, added it to the pre-ferment and combined everything
using the [pincer method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s).

Split the dough in half. One was lightly worked and left to ferment.

- 60g Flax seeds, soaked in 120g warm water overnight
- 60g Roasted Sunflower seeds

Added to the other half of the dough. Worked this one a little as well.

Both doughs finished at the target temperature of 28C.

## Bulk fermentation

Doughs fermented in a 24C kitchen for 3.5 hours, stretches every 15 or so
minutes the first hour.

## Shaping

I formed loose rounds and let them rest for 20 minutes. I then gave them a
stronger shape and left them on the counter to proof.

The dough with seeds was coated with more unroasted sunflower seeds.

## Baking

Baked in an oval dutch oven with lid for 30 minutes, then uncovered for 20
minutes. All at 245C.

Both came out quite tasty, if somewhat lacking in oven spring. I might have
overproofed them a tad.
