:published #time/ldt "2019-09-01T12:00:00"
:description

A batch of Ken Forkish' 50% whole wheat bread with a yeasted pre-ferment from
[Flour Water Salt Yeast](https://kensartisan.com/flour-water-salt-yeast/). Split
in half for batch fermentation and added flax seeds and roasted sunflower seeds
to one, and roasted sesames to the other.

Made the pre-ferment before going to bed, around 00:30. Kitchen was at 23C.

Hydrated and proofed the yeast in the warm water for a few minutes, until I
combined it all to a paste, added it to the pre-ferment and combined everything
using the [pincer method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s).

Split the dough in half. One was lightly worked and left to ferment.

- 60g Flax seeds, soaked in 120g warm water overnight
- 60g Roasted Sunflower seeds

Added to the other half of the dough. Worked this one a little as well.

:title Shaping

I formed loose rounds and let them rest for 20 minutes. I then gave them a
stronger shape and left them on the counter to proof.

The dough with seeds was coated with more unroasted sunflower seeds.

Baked in an oval dutch oven with lid for 30 minutes, then uncovered for 20
minutes. All at 245C.

Both came out quite tasty, if somewhat lacking in oven spring. I might have
overproofed them a tad.
