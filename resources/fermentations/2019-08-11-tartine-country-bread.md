Back from vacation. I brought the sourdough with me, and fed it with a mix of
white flour and Danish whole spelt flour pretty much once a day. I did forget it
for a couple of days, and it did take a dip into acetone landscape, but it was
back to sweet slightly overripe fruit by the time I got back.

## Autolyse

- 700g water
- 100g fine whole wheat flour
- 900g white wheat flour

Autolysed in 24C ambient temperature for 90 minutes.

## Dough

The levain was about 9 hours when I made the dough:

- 20g salt
- 200g levain

Combined roughly into the autolyse, using [Ken Forkish' pincer
method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s).

## Bulk fermentation

I gave the dough four turns at 30 minute intervals. Bulk fermentation went for
about three hours. It's not entirely clear from the Tartine book how long the
primary fermentation is supposed to last, and I don't currently have a good way
of gauging "30% increase in volume". Turns out, I under fermented my dough.

## Results

The final result is a massively under-fermented, dense bread. It wasn't really
good for eating - I have commercial yeast breads that are massively preferable
to this. I ended up making croutons of one loaf, and sadly, throwing out the
other one. Better luck next time!
