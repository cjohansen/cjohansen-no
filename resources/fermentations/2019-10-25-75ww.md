I wanted to try to apply the "strong folds" technique to a bread with more than
50% whole wheat. I'm starting with this dough of 75% whole wheat too see how it
develops.

I combined everything roughly into a dough. As I'm going to fold this early and
often, to develop the dough, so initial strength wasn't very important.

The dough temperature at the end of the mix was 28.2C.

Pre-rounded the dough, and let i rest for 15 minutes. Then folded the dough onto
