I roasted the pumpkin seeds, then combined everything roughly into a dough. As
I'm going to fold this early and often, to develop the dough, so initial
strength wasn't very important.

The dough temperature at the end of the mix was 28.1C.

:title Bulk fermentation
:time 210
:body

Performed fairly strong stretch and folds every 15 minutes the first hour, then
every 30 minutes until an hour before completed fermentation.

The dough developed nice strength and was gassy, but still quite sticky. I guess
the hydration level in combination with the amount of flax seeds is to blame for
this.

:title Shaping
:time 75
:body

As the dough was slightly sticky, shaping was really quite difficult. I
pre-rounded the dough, let it relax for 20 minutes, and then tried to shape it
into a batard. The first attempt was rather unsuccessful, so I ended up rolling
it into a round again, and trying again. I ended up with a sticky and loose
batard in the basket.

:title Baking
:time 50
:body

Sticky as the dough was, it stuck to the basket edge on the way out. This
flabbed the dough more than I expected, so the end result was predictably wide
and flabby. It still gained decent volume, so I think I can make something nice
of this, just reducing the hydration 5% or so.
