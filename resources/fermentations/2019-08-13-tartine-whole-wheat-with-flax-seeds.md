:title Tartine Whole Wheat with Flax and Sunflower Seeds
:description

My first attempt at the whole wheat dough from [Tartine
Bread](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8185785-tartine-bread).

Autolysed in 22C ambient temperature overnight.

I built the levain at the same time as the autolyse.

The levain was about 12 hours when I made the dough. Combined roughly into the
autolyse.

:title Seeds
:body

The book contains a variation on this dough that adds flax seeds and sunflower
seeds. This combination happens to be a house favorite, so I decided to try it,
even if I hadn't tried the base recipe. The recipe calls for:

- 1 cup sunflower seeds, roasted
- 1 cup flax seeds, soaked in 2 cups boiling water

I incorporated the seeds after the second turn, and immediately knew I'd made a
mistake. The base recipe is 70% whole wheat and 80% hydration - a very slack
dough. After adding the seeds, the total hydration is at a breezy 130%, and the
dough was just a mess.

I continued to give the dough turns at 30 minute intervals, hoping it would come
together, but it stayed a mess throughout, possibly with a little bit more hold
towards the end.

:title Shaping
:time 60
:body

I spent a good hour trying to shape this awful mess. I incorporated a metric
shit ton of raw flour in the process, but after four rounds, I was able to move
the sticky piles into a plate of sunflower seeds, and then into proofing
baskets. I stuck the baskets into the fridge for retarding, and to set the skin,
so I would be able to transfer the breads into Dutch ovens to cook.

:title Bake
:time 50

I baked these after 12 hours, and they turned out better than feared, if
somewhat flat.

They came out quite dense, almost closer to seeded rye breads than a typical
wheat bread. The crumb was tight, and sticky, almost wet. I probably should have
cooked them a little longer. They're probably way off from the potential in the
recipe, but they were still edible.
