In my second attempt at working with
[Tangzhong](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2018/03/26/introduction-to-tangzhong),
I tried my hand at King Arthur's recipe for [Hokkaido milk bread
rolls](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/japanese-milk-bread-rolls-recipe).

:title Tangzhong Roux
:ingredients
[{:type :white-wheat :amount 14}
 {:type :water :amount 43}
 {:type :milk :amount 43}]
:time 5

I whisked the flour into the water and milk to form a loose roux, and then
heated it to 67C in the microwave.

:title Dough
:ingredients
[{:type :butter :amount 57}
 {:type :egg :amount 1}
 {:type :milk :amount 113}
 {:type :white-wheat :amount 298}
 {:type :sugar :amount 50}
 {:type :milk-powder :amount 11}
 {:type :salt :amount 6}
 {:type :yeast :amount 6}]
:time 5
:body

I melted the butter into the warm roux, then whisked in cold milk and the egg.
The resulting dough was very sticky and loose, and my attempt at hand kneading
it was not very successful. I ended up incorporating quite a lot of flour to
make it work, and even so ended up with a dough that was probably
under-developed. Should probably use a machine for this dough the next time.

:title Bulk fermentation
:time 70
:body

As the dough has ridiculous amounts of yeast, it only needed a little over an
hour to bulge on the verge of collapsing.

:title Shaping and proofing
:time 50
:body

I cut the dough into 8 pieces, rolled each into a roll, and placed them in a
star-like pattern in a buttered 9" round cake pan. I covered the pan and let it
rise for another 45 minutes.

:title Baking
:time 30
:body

I brushed the rolls with eggwash, and then baked it for 25 minutes. The rolls
turned out wonderfully golden, and had grown into each other in just the right
way. The rolls where wonderfully soft and delicious, and was hugely popular with
the kids.
