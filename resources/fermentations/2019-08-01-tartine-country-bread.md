:title Tartine Country Bread
:description

Very excited after reading the [Tartine
book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8185785-tartine-bread), I finally got
to try my hands at the core recipe of the book - the Country Bread.

:title Dough
:ingredients
[{:type :levain :amount 200}
 {:type :salt :amount 20}]
:time 5
:body

The levain was about 11 hours when I made the dough. Combined roughly into the
autolyse, using [Ken Forkish' pincer
method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s).

:title Bulk fermentation
:time 180
:body

I gave the dough four turns at 30 minute intervals. Bulk fermentation went for
about three hours. It's not entirely clear from the Tartine book how long the
primary fermentation is supposed to last, and I don't currently have a good way
of gauging "30% increase in volume". Turns out, I under-fermented my dough.

:title Bake
:time 50
:body

The shaped loaves were proofed overnight in the refrigerator then cooked after
about 8 hours. They sadly came out dense and under-developed. Better luck next
time.
