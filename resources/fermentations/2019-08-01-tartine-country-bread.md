Very excited after reading the [Tartine
book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8185785-tartine-bread), I finally got
to try my hands at the core recipe of the book - the Country Bread.

## Autolyse

- 700g water
- 100g fine whole wheat flour
- 900g white wheat flour

Autolysed in 24C ambient temperature for 30 minutes.

## Dough

The levain was about 11 hours when I made the dough:

- 20g salt
- 200g levain

Combined roughly into the autolyse, using [Ken Forkish' pincer
method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s).

## Bulk fermentation

I gave the dough four turns at 30 minute intervals. Bulk fermentation went for
about three hours. It's not entirely clear from the Tartine book how long the
primary fermentation is supposed to last, and I don't currently have a good way
of gauging "30% increase in volume". Turns out, I under fermented my dough.

## Results

The shaped loaves were proofed overnight in the refrigerator then cooked after
about 8 hours. They sadly came out dense and under-developed. Better luck next
time.
