Another batch of Ken Forkish' 50% whole wheat bread with a yeasted pre-ferment
from [Flour Water Salt Yeast](https://kensartisan.com/flour-water-salt-yeast/).
Split in half for batch fermentation and added toasted sesames to half, and
toasted pumpkin seeds to the other half.

## Pre-ferment

Made the pre-ferment in the morning, with a bit more yeast than usual, to speed
things up. Kitchen was at 21C.

- 500g White wheat flour
- 340g Water
- 0.6g Yeast

## Dough

- 500g Fine whole wheat flour
- 460g Water, 38C
- 22g Salt
- 3g Yeast

Hydrated and proofed the yeast in the warm water for a few minutes, until I
combined it all to a paste, added it to the pre-ferment and combined everything
using the [pincer method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s).

Split the dough in half.

- 1dl toasted sesames

Added to half the dough.

- 1dl toasted pumpkin seeds

Added to the other half.

Both doughs finished at the target temperature of 28C.

## Bulk fermentation

Doughs fermented in a 23C kitchen for 3.5 hours, stretches every 15 or so
minutes the first hour.

## Shaping

I formed loose rounds and let them rest for 20 minutes. I then gave them a
stronger shape and left them on the counter to proof. The pumpkin seed one was
coated with more pumpkin seeds.

## Baking

Baked in dutch ovens with lid for 30 minutes, then uncovered for 20 minutes. All
at 245C.

I should have cooked these one shelf lower in the oven, as the middle brings the
top too close to the roof of the oven, burning the top seeds.
