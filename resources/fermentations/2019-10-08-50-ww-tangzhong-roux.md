Having recently read about
[Tangzhong](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2018/03/26/introduction-to-tangzhong),
I was curious to test it out. I decided to give it a go with a recipe that I
know well first - the 50% whole wheat bread.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:type :section
:title Pre-ferment
:ingredients
[{:type :white-wheat :amount 450}
 {:type :coarse-whole-wheat :amount 50}
 {:type :water :amount 340 :temperature 31}
 {:type :yeast :amount 0.5}]
:time 600
:body

Combined to a shaggy mass. Left in a 22C room while at work.

:title Tangzhong Roux
:ingredients
[{:type :white-wheat :amount 50}
 {:type :water :amount 250}]
:time 5
:body

I whisked the flour into the water to form a loose roux, and then heated it to
67C in the microwave. Using the microwave makes it a quick process, ensuring we
don't loose any water to evaporation.

:title Dough
:ingredients
[{:type :salt :amount 22}
 {:type :yeast :amount 3}
 {:type :fine-whole-wheat :amount 450}
 {:type :water :amount 210 :temperature 42}]
:time 5

When the pre-ferment was ready to go, the tangzhong was nicely cooled down. I
added the remaining liquid to the tangzhong, then worked in the dry stuff, and
combined everything into the pre-ferment using the [pincer
method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s) as per usual. Dough
temperature was 27C at the end of mixing.

Already at this point I could feel a definite difference in the dough - it
was a bit denser, and seemed to be a lower hydration dough, than the 80% it
really is. I guess this is a direct result of the gelatinized starches in the
tangzhong absorbing more liquid. Which is the whole point of this really.

:title Bulk fermentation
:time 210
:body

Let the dough rise in the warmest room in the house, giving it stretches every
15 minutes for the first hour.

:title Shaping
:time 70
:body

I shaped loose boules with the dough. Again, the dough was firmer and less tacky
than it usually is. The boules came out a little less gassy than normal. I'm not
sure if I accidentally degassed the dough too much while working it, or if the
dough was less developed, but the did seem to look smaller in their baskets.

:title Baking
:time 50
:body

Baked in dutch ovens as usual: 245C, 30 minutes with a lid on, 20 minutes with
the lid off.

The bread was decidedly softer and had a more moist crumb. It also had a bit
denser crumb. I would like to relate this to the fact that the boules looked
smaller than usual after shaping, but they did develop fully in the baskets, and
were no smaller than usual going into the dutch ovens. The house was cold this
day, so the denser crumb may be attributed to a poorer fermentation than usual,
or it could be the effect of the tangzhong.

The day after, the crust was also softer than usual, and the bread presented
quite differently than I'm used to. I'd need to repeat the experiment to see if
it's all the tangzhong. If it is, then maybe this recipe is not a good
application of the technique, as I felt that it took away a little from the
crispyness of the crust and the chewiness of the crumb.
