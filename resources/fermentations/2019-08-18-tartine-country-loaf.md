After yesterday's failed attempt at a white bread with poppy seeds, I decided to
try again, reducing the difficult ingredients.

## Autolyse

- 700g water
- 1000g white wheat flour

Autolyse sat in room temperature overnight.

## Levain

Starter is active and on a twice-a-day feeding schedule. I built a white levain
for the bread:

- 50g Starter
- 100g Water
- 100g White wheat flour

## Dough

I mixed the dough in the morning, the levain was at peak activity, 10 hours in.

- 20g salt
- 200g levain
- 50g butter

This time I left out the milk powder, and added the (reduced amount of) soft
butter in the original mix.

## Bulk fermentation

Turns every 30 minutes the first two hours. Let bulk ferment for a little over
six hours. Dough never developed any significant strength, so I definitely need
to figure out a better way of incorporating the butter.

## Shape

I pre-shaped into rounds, and at this stage I finally found the dough to have a
little tension. Shaped into boules and dunked them in poppy seeds after a 15
minute bench rest.

## Bake

Baked after 2.5 hours of proofing. Not much volume gained, but a little. Breads
had decent oven spring. They came out far from the ideal, but at least they'll
be edible.
