:title Tartine Country Bread with Butter and Poppy Seeds
:description

After yesterday's failed attempt at a white bread with poppy seeds, I decided to
try again, reducing the difficult ingredients.

Autolyse sat in room temperature overnight.

:title Levain
:ingredients
[{:type :sourdough-starter :amount 50 :indirect-use? true}
 {:type :white-wheat :amount 100 :indirect-use? true}
 {:type :water :amount 100 :indirect-use? true}]
:body

Starter is active and on a twice-a-day feeding schedule. I built a white levain
for the bread.

:title Dough
:ingredients
[{:type :levain :amount 200}
 {:type :salt :amount 20}
 {:type :butter :amount 50}]
:body

I mixed the dough in the morning, the levain was at peak activity, 10 hours in.
This time I left out the milk powder, and added the (reduced amount of) soft
butter in the original mix.

:title Bulk fermentation
:time 360
:body

Turns every 30 minutes the first two hours. Let bulk ferment for a little over
six hours. Dough never developed any significant strength, so I definitely need
to figure out a better way of incorporating the butter.

:title Shaping
:time 300
:body

I pre-shaped into rounds, and at this stage I finally found the dough to have a
little tension. Shaped into boules and dunked them in poppy seeds after a 15
minute bench rest.

:title Bake
:time 50
:body

Baked after 2.5 hours of proofing. Not much volume gained, but a little. Breads
had decent oven spring. They came out far from the ideal, but at least they'll
be edible.
