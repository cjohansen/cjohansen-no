:body

For my second attempt at the Tartine whole wheat bread I decided to make it
plain, as the seeded version was very difficult to work.

## Autolyse

- 800g water
- 300g white wheat flour
- 700g fine whole wheat flour

Autolysed in 22C ambient temperature overnight.

## Levain

I built the levain at the same time as the autolyse:

- 50g Starter
- 100g Water
- 50g Whole wheat flour
- 50g White wheat flour

## Dough

The levain was about 12 hours when I made the dough:

- 22g salt
- 200g levain

Combined roughly into the autolyse.

## Bulk fermentation

I gave the dough four turns at 30 minute intervals. Bulk fermentation went for
around five hours.

Wanting a do-over of the flax seeded version, I decided to split this dough in
half at the second turn. I added roasted sunflower seeds and soaked flax seeds
to half the dough, but this time I cut the amount in half. I still ended up with
a flabby mess of a dough that eventually ended up in the trash instead of the
proofing basket.

## Shaping

I pre-shaped the single bread, and let it rest for 20 minutes. For being a 70%
whole wheat bread, it had decent structure, but after 20 minutes it was floating
out relatively flat. I gave it another pre-shape and rest, then shaped it into a
decent boule, and put it in a proofing basket on the counter. Ambient
temperature was 23C.

## Results

I somehow forgot to take a picture of this loaf. It came out kinda flat, about
the same size as yesterday's seeded version. I actually didn't even cut it open,
it just went into the freezer... Not sure I learned much from this process,
other than that above 50% whole wheat is really hard, and I'm not even sure I'm
all that into it, flavor-wise.
