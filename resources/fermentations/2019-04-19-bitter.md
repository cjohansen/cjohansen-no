As I was waking up from my brewing sleep, I wanted a nice bitter on hand.

## Grist

- 2330g Maris Otter
- 350g CaraRed 150L
- 1160g Vienna
- 760g Munich II

## Water adjustments

- 2g CaSO4
- 6g CaCl

## Mash

- 16 liters of water, mash temp at 65C
- 20 minutes later, the temp was raised to 68C, the target temp
- 40 minues later, the temperature was raised to 74C for mash out

## Sparge

Did vorlauf and run-off. Then sparged, but forgot the second vorlauf. D'OH!
Decided to run all the wort through the grain bed again. Poured everything back,
waited 15 minutes, did another vorlauf, and then ran off into the kettle.

## Boil

Boiled 27 liters at BG 1.040, 76% efficiency. Threw out 2 liters of crud from
the mash.

- 50g EKG 6.5% 2015 @45min ~30IBU
- 50g EKG 6.5% 2015 @WP 37C

## Pitch

- OG 1.044
- Pitch S-04 20C
- 30 seconds O2

## Bottling

- FG 1.007

As I tasted this preparing to bottle, I realized that I'd messed up the grain
bill. The beer was unfixably too sweet and cloying. I've read about beginning
brewers screwing up with too much caramel malts many times, but I've never made
this mistake - I've mostly brewed Belgian beers with pilsner malt and wheat
malt. This was a refershing learning experience, and I dumped the entire thing
in the toilet instead of bottling, saving lots of time, and gaining some
experience.
