My kids' favorite bread is a sunflower seed and flax seed bread from [Hamelman's
Bread](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118132718/). This is an attempt at creating a
similar style of bread, using the Tartine Country Bread as a base.

## Autolyse

- 700g warm water
- 100g fine whole wheat flour
- 900g white wheat flour

Autolysed in 21C ambient temps for about two hours.

## Levain

Starter is active and on a twice-a-day feeding schedule. I built the levain at
23:30 last night:

- 50g Starter
- 100g Water
- 50g Whole wheat flour
- 50g White wheat flour

## Dough

Again, for practical reasons, I was unable to use the levain as young as I had
intended. The dough was mixed at 13:30, so the levain was 14 hours old, and
already receding in activity. Still, I detect barely any sourness beyond the
pleasant tang you expect from an active culture.

- 22g salt
- 200g levain

Combined roughly into the autolyse.

## Seeds

- 130g sunflower seeds, roasted
- 75g flax seeds, soaked in 150g boiling water

I gave the dough turns at 30 minute intervals, and after the first two (1 hour
of fermentation), I incorporated the seeds.

## Shaping

![Fermenting dough](/images/bread/IMG_1496.jpg)

This dough fermented fantastically. After 6 hours, it was very gassy, and
pillowy soft to touch - it held its shape nicely, and did not degass much with
handling. Pre-shaped into rounds, did a 30 minute bench rest, then shaped into
two boules.

## Proofing

I proofed one boule on the counter for about two hours, then baked. The other I
slightly folded and dropped into a long basket, something I've seen Chad
Robertson do. It didn't really work well, so next time I'll definitely shape a
batard if that is what I'm going for...

## Baking

Baked at 235C, to reduce darkening of the crust. My kids don't like it when "it
tastes burnt". I don't like burnt bread either, but we have different opinions
about when bread burns...
