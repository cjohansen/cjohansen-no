:title Tartine Country Bread with Flax and Sunflower Seeds
:description

My kids' favorite bread is a sunflower seed and flax seed bread from [Hamelman's
Bread](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118132718/). This is an attempt at creating a
similar style of bread, using the Tartine Country Bread as a base.

Autolysed in 21C ambient temps for about two hours.

Starter is active and on a twice-a-day feeding schedule. I built the levain at
23:30 last night.

Again, for practical reasons, I was unable to use the levain as young as I had
intended. The dough was mixed at 13:30, so the levain was 14 hours old, and
already receding in activity. Still, I detect barely any sourness beyond the
pleasant tang you expect from an active culture.

:ingredients
[{:type :sunflower-seeds :amount 130}
 {:type :flax :amount 75}
 {:type :water :amount 150}]

I gave the dough turns at 30 minute intervals, and after the first two (1 hour
of fermentation), I incorporated the seeds - sunflower seeds were roasted, flax
seeds were soaked.

This dough fermented fantastically. After 6 hours, it was very gassy, and
pillowy soft to touch - it held its shape nicely, and did not degass much with
handling. Pre-shaped into rounds, did a 30 minute bench rest, then shaped into
two boules.

:title Proof
:time 120
:body

I proofed one boule on the counter for about two hours, then baked. The other I
slightly folded and dropped into a long basket, something I've seen Chad
Robertson do. It didn't really work well, so next time I'll definitely shape a
batard if that is what I'm going for...

:title Baking
:time 50
:body

Baked at 235C, to reduce darkening of the crust. My kids don't like it when "it
tastes burnt". I don't like burnt bread either, but we have different opinions
about when bread burns...
