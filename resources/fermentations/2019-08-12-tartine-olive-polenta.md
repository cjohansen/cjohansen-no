The [Tartine book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8185785-tartine-bread)
has multiple variations on its basic recipe which is created by cutting
additional ingredients into the dough after starting bulk fermentation. This
technique has the benefit of allowing you to create one big dough, and making
variations out of portions of it later, simplifying everything. I really liked
this approach, and decided to test it by making a single dough, and using it to
try out two variations.

## Autolyse

- 700g water
- 100g fine whole wheat flour
- 900g white wheat flour

## Dough

The levain was about 12 hours when I made the dough:

- 20g salt
- 200g levain

Combined roughly into the autolyse.

## Variations

After the second turn/stretch and fold, I cut the dough in two, and added
walnuts, olives and Herbs de Provence to once half, and a porrige of polenta, water,
roasted pumpkin seeds, and rosemary to the other half.

I then proceeded to bulk ferment each dough separately, giving both another two
turns.

One mistake I made was adding too big pieces of olive. The idea was that the
bread knife will cut most up eventually anyway, but in practice, the huge pieces
(half big green olives) kept "falling out" of the dough as I gave it turns,
which was annoying. Next time, I'll add slightly smaller pieces to the dough.

## Shaping

Being an inexperienced sourdough baker, I was on thin ice doing these breads.
All the additives made it much harder to gauge the fermentation process.
Eventually I just shaped the breads and threm them into proofing baskets, opting
for a cold retarding.

## Results

The olive bread was probably under developed, probably due to an incomplete bulk
fermentation, but it was still crazy good. Can't wait to master this for real.

The polenta was a hit with my kids, somewhat surprisingly, given the rosemary in
it. It suffered some of the same problems as the olive bread, but the additives
still made it a moist and flavorful bread.
