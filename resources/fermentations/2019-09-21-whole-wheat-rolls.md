:title Shaping
:time 80
:body

I cut the dough in half, and shaped one half into a loose boule. I then cut the
remaining dough into ~110g pieces, and shaped them into rolls. After I was done
with the rolls, the big piece was sufficiently relaxed to be shaped into a
batard. It went into a proofing basket and then the fridge. The rolls were
dipped in egg wash and then either sesame seeds or wheat bran, then proofed on
the counter for an hour.
