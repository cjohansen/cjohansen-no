Making yesterday's [/fermentations/2019-10-11-hokkaido/](Hokkaido), I realized
that the dough was very similar to the one I use for cinnamon rolls. So I
figured I'd try a round of cinnamon rolls using
[tangzhong](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2018/03/26/introduction-to-tangzhong),
adjusting the dough to more closely resemble the Hokkaido, for its softness.

:title Tangzhong Roux
:ingredients
[{:type :white-wheat :amount 50}
 {:type :milk :amount 250}]

I whisked the flour into the milk to form a loose roux, and then heated it to
67C in the microwave, at which point it turned into a gooey paste.

:ingredients
[{:type :milk :amount 350}
 {:type :egg :amount 2}
 {:type :sugar :amount 150}
 {:type :white-wheat :amount 950}
 {:type :salt :amount 6}
 {:type :yeast :amount 4}
 {:type :cardamom :amount 5}]
:time 15

I whisked cold milk into the warm roux, and then added the eggs. The resulting
liquid was the perfect temperature for using straight away. I then combined the
liquid and all the dry ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer, and ran it at
low speed for 10 minutes.

:title Butter
:ingredients
[{:type :butter :amount 150}]
:time 15
:body

I added the room temperature butter, dice by dice with the machine running,
waiting to incorporate each bit before adding another. After all the butter was
added, I cranked up the machine to medium, and let it run for 10 more minutes.

The dough temperature at the end of kneading was 31C, a little bit on the hot
side.

:title Bulk fermentation
:time 270
:body

Bulk fermentation went for four and a half hours, until the dough had more than
tripled in size. I didn't give it any stretch and folds, as it had lots of
strength from the long machine mix.

:title Shaping
:time 15
:ingredients
[{:type :butter :amount 125}
 {:type :sugar :amount 125}
 {:type :cinnamon :amount 2}]
:body

I turned the dough onto the table, and rolled it out using a rolling pin, until
it was roughly rectangular and about 1cm thick. I then spread the soft butter
evenly on top, and sprinkled on the [toasted
sugar](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/05/dry-toasted-sugar-granulated-caramel-recipe.html)/cinnamon
mixture.

I then folded the right third of the dough over the middle, and then the left
third over that again, and cut 1-2 cm slices. To shape the knots, I rolled each
end of the slices in opposite direction, and then tied a knot with the twisted
slice.

:title Proofing

I proofed the knots for 60 minutes.

:title Baking
:time 30
:ingredients
[{:type :egg :amount 1}
 {:type :milk :amount 50}
 {:type :pearl-sugar}]
:body

I whisked the egg and milk, and then brushed the knots with it. Finally I
sprinkled a generous amount of pear sugar on each knot, then slid both trays in
the oven. I baked for 10 minutes, then rotated both trays and switch their
places, then baked for another 10 minutes. At this point the top tray was
perfectly cooked, but the knots on the lower one where still a bit on the light
side. I left the bottom tray in the oven for another few minutes.

Knots came out super moist and very tasty. I would say the Tangzhong made a
noticable difference in these, and I will keep using it in this recipe going
forward.
