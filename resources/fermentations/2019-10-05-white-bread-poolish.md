[{:type :white-wheat :amount 500}
 {:type :water :amount 500 :temperature 28}
 {:type :yeast :amount 0.3}]

Combined to a lump-free poolish, and left in the rather cold kitchen overnight.
For practical reasons, I didn't get to it until 14 and a half hours in, but it
was still at its prime.

[{:type :salt :amount 22}
 {:type :yeast :amount 3}
 {:type :white-wheat :amount 500}
 {:type :water :amount 250 :temperature 42}]

Loosened the poolish with the water. Combined flour, salt and yeast, and then
combined everything to a dough using the [pincer
method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s) as usual. The dough
temperature was 26C.

:title Variation
:ingredients
[{:type :butter :amount 30}]
:time 15
:body

15 minutes after making the dough I split it in half and worked butter into half
of it. I wanted to see if this would take me closer to the soft weekend bread
I'm craving.

:title Bulk fermentation
:time 210
:body

Left both doughs in a rather chilly 21C kitchen for three and a half hours,
giving both stretches four times during the first hour.

:title Shaping
:time 70
:body

Shaped both doughs into relatively loose rounds. Allowed them to rest for 10
minutes, then shaped each round into a batard, trying to not knock too much gas
out. The straight dough was rolled in poppy seeds before going into the basket,
while the buttered version was rolled in sesame seeds.

The buttered version went into the fridge, as I can only bake one batard at a
time.

:title Baking
:time 50
:body

Baked in an oval dutch oven at 245C. 30 minutes covered, 20 minutes uncovered. I
slashed the straight dough with a lame. It had great oven spring and a wonderful
tear.

The straight dough was easily one of my best white breads - wonderfully airy
crumb, the flavor of the poppy seeds permeated the bread and blended wonderfully
with the flavors from fermentation. The crust was paper thin and wonderfully
crispy.

The buttered dough was a bit of a dud, as it was obviously either over-proofed
or under-developed - probably a bit of both. The butter inhibits the gluten, and
I guess giving this bread the longer proof time wasn't a smart move. The next
time I try something like this, I'll make 'em round, so I can bake them
simultaneously. On the other hand - the straight dough turned out to be the kind
of bread I relly wanted, so maybe butter is an unnecessary addition here.
