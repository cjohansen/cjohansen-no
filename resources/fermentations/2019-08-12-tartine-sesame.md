The levain was about 12 hours when I made the dough. Combined roughly into the
autolyse.

- 1 cup sesame seeds, roasted

I incorporated the seeds after the second turn, about an hour into bulk
fermentation.

After incorporating the seeds, I gave the dough another 2 turns, and it
developed nicely. I then left it for another hour.

I pre-shaped the loaves, then pulled them into a boule about 20 minutes later.
Both breads went into the refrigerator for retarding, and was cooked about 10
hours later.

The sesame country bread was quite a success. It's not exactly "WOW, open
crumb!", but it was decently light in texture, and the sesame seeds really
helped break up the density of the crumb. This is likely going to be one of my
favorites once I master a better fermentation. Sesame seeds are awesome.
