Another attempt at the Tartine Country Bread, this time with a load of sesame
seeds.

## Autolyse

- 700g water
- 900g white wheat flour
- 100g fine whole wheat flour

Autolysed in 24C ambient temperature for around 2 hours.

## Dough

The levain was about 12 hours when I made the dough:

- 22g salt
- 200g levain

Combined roughly into the autolyse.

## Seeds

- 1 cup sesame seeds, roasted

I incorporated the seeds after the second turn, about an hour into bulk
fermentation.

## Bulk fermentation

After incorporating the seeds, I gave the dough another 2 turns, and it
developed nicely. I then left it for another hour.

## Shaping

I pre-shaped the loaves, then pulled them into a boule about 20 minutes later.
Both breads went into the refrigerator for retarding, and was cooked about 10
hours later.

## Results

The sesame country bread was quite a success:

It's not exactly "WOW, open crumb!", but it was decently light in texture, and
the sesame seeds really helped break up the density of the crumb. This is likely
going to be one of my favorites once I master a better fermentation. Sesame
seeds are awesome.
