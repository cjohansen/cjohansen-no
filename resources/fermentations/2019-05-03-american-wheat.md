:body

I wanted a relatively plain summer beer to offer just about anyone that made it
into my house over the summer.

## Grist

- 3000g Pilsnermalt
- 3000g Hvetemalt
- 250g Munich II

## Water adjustments

- 3g CaSO4
- 3g CaCl2
- 4g CaCO3 (Balanced profile Brewer's friend)

## Mash

- Water volume: 18 liters
- Strike water temp: 75C
- 7.6 ml 75% Phosphoric acid
- Target temp 67C

## Sparge

Sparged with 18 liters of 80C water with 0.79ml 75% phosphoric acid after 45
minutes. I made a mistake watching the clock, and ended the mash at 45 minutes,
thinking I ended it at 90 minutes...

## Boil

90 minute boil.

- 31 liters, BG 1.050, 80% efficiency
- 50g EKG 6.5% @60 min
- 5g Supermoss @15min
- 1/4ts yeast nutrient @15min
- 25g Hallertau Mittelfruh @5min
- 25g Cascade 70C WP

IBU: ~25

## Pitch

- OG: 1.052
- 2 satchels of S-04, rehydrated
- STC set for 19C

## Re-pitch

Owing to my clock misreading during the mash, S-04 gave up at about 1.018, which
was too high for my taste. I pitched some US-05 into 500ml of wort, then added
the frothing substance after about 4 fours, along with 15 grams of Nelson
Sauvin.

## Bottling

After a few days, the beer was at 1.014, so cold crashed it with gelatine and
let it sit for a few days.

After bottling the beer was refreshing and nice, but the Nelson hops where much
too noticable. The goal with this beer was to have a relatively neutral beer on
hand for guests, and the Nelson made it a special interest beer. Luckily, after
quite some weeks, it is just as uninteresting as intended, and I can hand it out
to anyone.
