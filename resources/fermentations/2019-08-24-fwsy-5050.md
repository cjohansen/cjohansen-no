One of mye absolute favorite breads is Ken Forkish' 50% whole wheat bread with a
yeasted pre-ferment from
[Flour Water Salt Yeast](https://kensartisan.com/flour-water-salt-yeast/).

## Pre-ferment

Made at 00:30 before going to bed:

- 500g White wheat flour
- 340g Water
- 0.3g Yeast

Combined and let rest in room temperature ~22C.

## Dough

- 500g Fine whole wheat flour
- 460g Water, 38C
- 22g Salt
- 3g Yeast

Hydrated and proofed the yeast in the warm water for a few minutes, until I
combined it all to a paste, added it to the pre-ferment and combined everything
using the [pincer method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s).

Gave the dough some stretches to develop it a little, and finished the mix with
the dough at the target temperature of 28C.

## Bulk fermentation

Bulk fermentation lasted for 4 hours in a 25C kitchen - pushing it. Stretches
and folds every 15 minutes, starting 30 minutes in. 4 in total.

## Shaping

The dough was at its very peak, threatening to collapse as I pulled it out to
the table. Split in half, formed loose rounds and let rest 15 minutes. Then
shaped rough batards, and transferred to appropriate baskets. Because I don't
have a big enough oven to fit two oval cast irons, I can only bake one elongated
bread at a time. So I transferred one basket to the refrigerator immediately.

The second loaf went for 50 minutes in a 25C kitchen.

## Baking

Baked in an oval dutch oven with lid for 30 minutes, then uncovered for 15
minutes. All at 245C. Immediately after pulling the first loaf, I baked the
second one from the fridge. It was a tinge over-proofed, but came out very nice
all the same.
