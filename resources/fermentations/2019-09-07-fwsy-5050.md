New weekend, and I need more Ken Forkish' 50% whole wheat bread with a yeasted
pre-ferment from [Flour Water Salt
Yeast](https://kensartisan.com/flour-water-salt-yeast/).

Made the pre-ferment before going to bed, around 23:30. Kitchen was at 20C, it's
getting colder outside.

Hydrated and proofed the yeast in the warm water for a few minutes, until I
combined it all to a paste, added it to the pre-ferment and combined everything
using the [pincer method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoY7CPw0E1s).

Dough was at the target temperature of 28C at the end of mixing.

the first hour.

I formed loose rounds and let them rest for 20 minutes. I then gave them a
stronger shape and left them on the counter to proof in a basket.
