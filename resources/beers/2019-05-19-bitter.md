:title London Pride-inspired Bitter

London Pride is one of my goto beers, and luckily there is a [London Pride: Can
you brew it](http://www.thebrewingnetwork.com/post1621/) podcast episode that
includes an interview with Fuller's head brewer, who gives it all away. I
decided to try my hand at this beer using the information here.
