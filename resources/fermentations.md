I ferment flour into bread doughs on a weekly basis, and I ferment malt into
beer on a fairly regular basis. Occasionally I ferment chilli peppers, _kraut_,
and other things as well. This is a **blog** in its most literal form - a web
log of my fermentations. I write these log entries first and foremost as an
experience log and learning tool for myself - and to have something to point to
from forum posts etc. If you find anything of interest here, all the better. If
you'd like to talk fermentations, I'm [@cjno on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/cjno), and my email address is
[christian@cjohansen.no](mailto:christian@cjohansen.no).
